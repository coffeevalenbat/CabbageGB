# CabbageGB
Unfinished source code for the not shown Cabbage Gameboy, part of the Shoshinkai Archive Show ARG.

# Had to do something with the Source Code :P
So yeah, this is my last copy of the Cabbage Gameboy game source, Made on the **Game Maker Studio 1.4.1804** engine, 
It probably is possible to port this to the newer (and shittier imo) Game Maker Studio 2, but that's up to you.

I tried my best to comment this whole thing out but any questions please ask me.

# Credits...?
Coffee Bat - most of the thing, code, etc.

K-Dubs - some of the artwork.
